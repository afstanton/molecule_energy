This package is intended to perform energy calculations for chemical structures. Given a "molecule_core" data structure and an available method of calculating energy, this should perform calculations to return a value.

Ideally, someone should be able to build their own package based off this one to implement their own energy calculations. I have not figured that part out yet.
